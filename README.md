## Warning

Please note that the package is in 1) in development; and 2) mostly written for specific project (if it even works). Obviously, since it's puslished here and licensed under the GPL, you are free to use it as you please, but it is not really recommended (at this time).


## Installation

This package uses the method of rstanarm and the rstantools package to pre-build the stan
model on installation so that it won't need compiling every time the package loads.

Installation instructions will appear here when they've been tested.
