# An rstan model for groups of related contingency tables

A multilevel binomial--beta model for groups of contingency tables implemented in rstan.


## Installation

This package uses the method of rstanarm and the rstantools package to pre-build the stan
model on installation so that it won't need compiling every time the package loads.

Installation instructions will appear here when they've been tested.
